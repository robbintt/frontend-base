#### TODO:
Looks like there isn't any default css minifier. Add one! See sage/roots gulpfile.

#### Status:
Bower has been installed, gulp has been installed.  Dependencies are now kept in source control.
In order to unpack this project in a new space:

1. install npm, gulp, bower.
2. gulp has dependencies in gulpfile.js, bower has dependencies in bower.json.
3. Put your assets in the src folder.
4. node_modules, dist (compiled destination of src files), and bower_components are not kept under source control. These can be rebuilt by installing each. dist is built by running 'gulp'

#### Notes:
- This git repository is very conservative, only ignoring the following: node_modules.
The purpose of this is to allow particular projects 
A bower init has already been completed. This may need revisited.
- There are options in gulpfule.js to make the bower command install or update.
-This needs to be broken into two commands because bower dir is in gitignore .gitignore!!
- Added bower dependencies to satisfy the needs of pinax-bootstrap.
- These dependencies need to be wired into gulp and subsequently into whatever base.html or site_base.html is used by the web app.

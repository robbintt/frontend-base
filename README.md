## Notes:
This git repository is very conservative, only ignoring the following: node_modules.
The purpose of this is to allow particular projects 
A bower init has already been completed. This may need revisited.
There are options in gulpfule.js to make the bower command install or update.
THIS NEEDS TO BE BROKEN INTO TWO COMMAND BECAUSE BOWER PACKAGES WILL BE IN .gitignore!!
